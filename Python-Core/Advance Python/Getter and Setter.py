'''
▶ Getters and Setters in python are often used when:
  ● We use getters & setters to add validation logic around getting and setting a value.
  ● To avoid direct access of a class field i.e. private variables cannot be accessed directly or modified by external user.
'''

''' Code Explanation:
The code prompts the user for the account holder's name and the initial balance when creating the account.
A loop is provided to allow the user to deposit, withdraw, or set a new balance until they choose to exit.
Each action is prompted for the necessary amount, and the current balance is displayed after each operation.

    def __init__(self, name, balance):
        self.__name = name  # Private attribute - accessible only within the class

        self.__balance += amount 

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount <= self.__balance: 
            self.__balance -= amount
        else:
            print("Insufficient funds")

            self.__balance = amount
