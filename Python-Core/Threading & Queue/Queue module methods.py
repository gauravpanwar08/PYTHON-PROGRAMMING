====================== Python 'queue' Module Methods ======================

1. put(item)        → Adds item, blocks if queue is full.
2. put_nowait(item) → Adds without blocking, raises queue.Full if full.
3. get()            → Removes item, blocks if queue is empty.
4. get_nowait()     → Removes without blocking, raises queue.Empty if empty.
5. qsize()          → Returns current size.
6. empty()          → Checks if queue is empty.
7. full()           → Checks if queue is full.
8. task_done()      → Used by consumer threads to signal that a task fetched with get() is done.
9. join()           → Blocks until all items in the queue have been marked as done using task_done().
